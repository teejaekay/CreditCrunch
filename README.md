This is a simple application to demonstrate the various benefits of credit cards. 
The app utilizes the web API "ccstack" to retrieve information of over 2,000 credit cards. 
The user will be have access to reward information pertaining to individual cards and can 
see where to earn the maximum amount of rewards with a given card on a map view.

Navigate repository files to see screenshots and a video demo of the application.

Downlaoding and running the xcode project after December 2020 will not show proper functionality of app
as the API key will have expired.
